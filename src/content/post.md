## How do I use this?

### Installing Deno

To install Deno, follow the [docs here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation),
You can then clone or download [this starter](https://github.com/cssandstuff/11ty-deno-htmx)

For local development run the deno command: <pre>deno task dev</pre>

To deploy to deno.deploy you just need to [sign up for an account](https://deno.com/deploy), then once logged in you can create a new project and point it to your github repo.

<!-- I am writing a blog post about this project which has [more details](http://cssandstuff.deno.dev/writing/pairing-eleventy-with-htmx-and-deno/). -->
